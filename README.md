# LandingPageProjectt
This is the landing page project for TOP 

This is the first major project from "The Odin Project" in the foundations coursework. It utilizes what I have learned about CSS and HTML before heading into the introduction to Javascript.

It is a simple landing page I plan on continuing to work on with some flourishes over time.
